# Upgradable Immutable Verification Protocol
---

The Upgradable Immutable Verification Protocol is a distributed ledger agnostic, upgradable, architecture to store data in an immutable way and verify the ownership of this data with the help of oracles. It focuses on a simple initial setup based on a digital signature system and the future upgradability to a more complex distributed oracle system, which can verify data immutable on-chain. The message overhead is reduced to a minimum to be usable with as many DLTs as possible and in the case of transaction fees to reduce the costs. The first use case is based on invoice fraud.
